Our eccentric client is willing to pay us to make a record collection tracker for them.

The basic object:

```javascript
{
artist: "ARTISTNAME",
imageUrl: "LINKTOIMAGE",
name: "ALBUMNAME",
releaseYear: YEARRELEASED
}
```

The data should be kept in a Mongo DB and displayed on the page that uses bootstrap for styling:

- Jumbotron headline
- Boostrap grid to show the records

Client asks that the ability to create and remove records be present in the first iteration.

Example: [https://jemn-stack-review.herokuapp.com/](https://jemn-stack-review.herokuapp.com/)

_note_: SQUARE ALBUM COVER PICTURES PLZ

If time and budget allows, the ability to edit existing records will be greatly appreciated.
